## My Snake Game Project
For this project, I used the DoublyLinkedList data structure implemented in homework. It includes the following methods:

-__init__(): initializes an empty list
-__str__(): returns a string representing the list
-is_empty(): returns True if list is empty, False otherwise
-get_size(): returns size of list
-add_first(v): adds v at head of list
-add_last(v): adds v at end of list
-remove_first(): removes and returns first value in list
-remove_last(): removes and returns last value in list
-first(): returns first value in list
-last(): returns last value in list
-search(v): returns index of value if found and -1 otherwise
-get(i): returns value at index i

I used a function to verify that my DoublyLinkedList works.

## The Game
-I thought about what classes to create and what data they should have.
-I represented the world as a grid and set the x and y scale accordingly.
-I used the following starting code for the main part of my program:
        limit = 20 # number of frames to allow to pass before snake moves
        timer = 0  # timer to keep track of number of frames that passed
        while(True):
            timer += 1
            # process keyboard press here
            if timer == limit:
                timer = 0
                # draw and move snake
                # check if snake ate fruit
                # check if snake self intersects
        
            dudraw.show(40)

This ensures that keyboard presses are processed in timely fashion while also making sure the snake is moving at a reasonable speed.
